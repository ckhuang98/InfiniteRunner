Creative Tilt(Technical): We added a high score to track the minutes and seconds from a timer 
that was not shown in class, and developed a random spawning algorithm for obstacles in the game that was not covered in class.
Creative Tilt(Artistic): Our endless runner has it's own style as we created completely original art 
with the exception of all sound assets, which are cited below. We attempted something new with our endless 
runner by having the gameplay be dependent on a light mechanic which only allowed the player to 
see a portion of the screen. The menu and game over screen were meant to give off an eerie effect to add to the visual style. */
